# BJS PR BountyPool

## Definition
Bounties are simply _incentives for closing (fixing) issues and pushing BabylonJS forward for the benefit of our **awesome**, growing community!_. Active bounties for the BabylonJS PR Bounty Pool are the open issues in this project. When the issue is closed on the offical BabylonJS repo by a PR, the author of that PR is considered eligible for the bounty. Bounty rewards typically range from **$50** to **$1000** and paid out promptly within weeks after following the instructions outlined further down.

Open Bounties
These open and smaller can be worked on by anyone until closed by a mod. Be curtious and mention with a comment that you are working on the bounty so it can be labeled as In Progress. The first person to submit a resolution for an open bounty that fits it's specs and accepted by the BJS team will me the claimer of the issue and marked as closed. 

Open RFPs
Bounties with a certain complexity will be labeled as RFP Open. RFP stands for Request For Proposal. Developers wishing to tackle these issue should use the [RFP Issue Template](https://www.google.com)
