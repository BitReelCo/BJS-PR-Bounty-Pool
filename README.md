# BJS PR BountyPool

## Definition
Bounties are simply _incentives for closing (fixing) issues and pushing BabylonJS forward for the benefit of our **awesome**, growing community!_. Active bounties for the BabylonJS PR Bounty Pool are the open issues in this project. When the issue is closed on the offical BabylonJS repo by a PR, the author of that PR is considered eligible for the bounty. Bounty rewards typically range from **$50** to **$1000** and paid out promptly within weeks after following the instructions outlined further down.
