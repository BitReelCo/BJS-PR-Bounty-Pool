# BJS PR BountyPool

## Definition
Bounties are simply _incentives for closing (fixing) issues and pushing BabylonJS forward for the benefit of our **awesome**, growing community!_. Active bounties for the BabylonJS PR Bounty Pool are the open issues in this project. When the issue is closed on the offical BabylonJS repo by a PR, the author of that PR is considered eligible for the bounty. Bounty rewards typically range from **$50** to **$1000** and paid out promptly within 2-3 weeks after following the instructions outlined further down.

### Open Bounties
These open and smaller bounties can be worked on by anyone until closed by a mod. Be curtious and mention with a comment that you are working on the bounty so it can be labeled as In Progress early on and you as the claimer. See the instructions below for submmitting your fix.

### Open RFPs
Bounties with a certain complexity will be labeled as RFP Open. RFP stands for Request For Proposal. Developers wishing to tackle these issue should use the [RFP Issue Template](https://www.google.com) and open an issue with their proposal, making sure to change the #Bounty# in the RFP Template issue's title. Your proposal will be reviewed by the mods and either accepted, rejected, more clearification or perhaps changes requested. Once accepted the Open RFP Issue will be marked In Progress and only can be claimed by the RFP author unless the issue becomes inactive and Open again.

## Submitting an Open Bounty Fix
* Find an issue that fits your skills and interests on the [Bounty Board](https://github.com/BitReelCo/BJS-PR-Bounty-Pool)'s open issues and comment and fix it or comment a proposal!
