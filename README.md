## Mission
Bounties in this pool are _incentives for pushing BabylonJS forward for the benefit of our **awesome** and growing community!_ Active bounties for the BabylonJS PR Bounty Pool are the open issues in this project. When the claim issue is opened on the offical BabylonJS repo(s) by a PR, the author of that PR is considered eligible for the bounty once reviewed by the BJS team and the bounties criteria is met to a satisfactory degree. Bounty rewards typically range from **$50** to **$1000** and paid out promptly within 2-3 weeks after following the instructions outlined further down.

### Open Bounties
These **[Open Bounty]** issues are smaller features and bugfixes that can be claimed and worked on by anyone until closed by a mod. Be curtious and mention with a comment that you are working on the bounty so it can be labeled as In Progress and claimed early on. When you are finished, follow the instructions below for submmitting your fix.

### Open RFPs
Bounties with a certain complexity will be labeled as **[Open RFP]**. RFP stands for Request For Proposal. Developers wishing to tackle these issue should use the [RFP Issue Template](https://github.com/BitReelCo/BJS-PR-Bounty-Pool/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RFP&template=-rfp--create-a-proposal-for-your-potential-submission-for-a-bounty.md&title=%5BRFP%5D) and open an issue with their proposal, making sure to change the #Bounty# in the RFP Template issue's title. Your proposal will be reviewed by the mods and either accepted, rejected, more clearification or perhaps changes requested. Once accepted the Open RFP Issue will be marked In Progress and only can be claimed by the RFP author unless the issue becomes inactive and Open again.

## Submitting an Open Bounty Fix
* Find an issue that fits your skills and interests on the [Bounty Board](https://github.com/BitReelCo/BJS-PR-Bounty-Pool)'s open issues and comment and fix it or comment a proposal!
* Open a Pull Request with your work back in the [BabylonJS Main Repo](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) or which ever BJS repo(s) your bounty claim pertains to!
* Include "fixes Bounty # ..." at the beginning of its title followed by it's change. Once the PR is approved and merged by the BJS team, simply message [br-matt](https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/br-matt) on the BabylonJS forums for further details on claiming the reward.

# Getting help!
Are you curious or stuck on a certain Bounty ? Well the team and community will be more than glad to help you on the [BabylonJS Community Forums](https://forum.babylonjs.com/) and make sure to mention you are working on a Bounty.

## Issues being reopened _*(important)*_
Mods of the BJS BountyPool reserve the right to reopen any Open Bounties or Open RFP at any time. This would be rare but one reason will be **inactivity** if the developer not responding for 20 calendar days or showing little or no effort towards progress. See **Getting Help** section above!!
